#Description Messages
personamap.description = Persona Mappings are used as one of the User Centered Design methods that we use to clearly identify our prospective users. The Picture represents prioritized tiers of user groups in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of the product are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process and development life cycle.  The persona attributes are mapped to mock-ups to evaluate the fit for use to meet the user needs. As the understanding of Personas and the product evolves so does the mapping of how the application supports their needs, wants and limitations. 
focus.description = Focus Groups are used for qualitative research and to explore the opinions, knowledge, perceptions, and concerns of individuals in regards to the product and how it will be used. A focus group involves encouraging an invited group of intended/actual users of a site (i.e. participants) to share their thoughts, feelings, attitudes and ideas on a certain subject. The participants are encouraged to freely give their honest opinions about the value of each product feature, including suggestions for new features.
bht.description = Business Hypothesis Testing is a foundational part of our User Centered Design that we use to identify potential value propositions for users of our software. Products developed using this methodology is optimized for what end-users identify as valuable.  User feedback loops from actual software usage continually tests these hypothesis to inform future planning, prioritization and development activities.
pair.description = Pair Programming involves having two programmers working at a single workstation. One programmer "drives" operating the keyboard, while the other "navigates" watching, learning, asking and making suggestions. In theory, the driver focuses on the code at hand: the syntax, semantics, and algorithm. The navigator focuses less on that, and more on a level of abstraction higher: the test they are trying to get to pass, the technical task to be delivered next, and the time elapsed since all the tests were run, the time elapsed since the last repository commit, and the quality of the overall design. This practice results in better designs, fewer bugs, and much better spread of knowledge across a development team, and therefore more functionality per unit time, measured over the long term.
lean.description = Lean/Kanban system is used as a cornerstone for a culture of continuous improvement. We follow Kanban board as a workflow visualization tool that enables us to optimize the flow of our work and to communicate status, progress & concerns about the project in daily Stand ups that leads to increased communication and collaboration.  The Kanban board also allows us to manage Work in Progress (WIP) which encourages taking on work in "small batches" that minimize wasted time.
mobile.description = Bootstrap and jQuery implementation enables the application to be viewed in any mobile device demonstrating responsiveness to any size.
