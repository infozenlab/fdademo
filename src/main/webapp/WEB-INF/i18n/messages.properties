#Description Messages
personamap.description = We used persona mappings as one of the User Centered Design methods to clearly identify our prospective users. The picture is representative of the prioritized tiers of user groups that we defined, including their needs, wants, and limitations.  We gave extensive attention to "how" each persona would get value from our product at each stage of the design process and development life cycle.  The persona attributes were mapped to mock-ups to evaluate the fit for use to meet the user needs, and as the understanding of personas and the product evolved, so did the mapping of how the application supports their needs, wants and limitations. 
focus.description = We used focus groups for qualitative research regarding the opinions, knowledge, perceptions, and concerns of individuals in regards to the product and how it is used. We encouraged each focus group of intended users to share their thoughts, feelings, attitudes and ideas on a certain product usage scenario/feature set. The participants were encouraged to freely give their honest opinions about the value of each product feature, including suggestions for new features.
bht.description = A foundational part of our User Centered Design was business hypothesis testing, which was used to identify potential product value propositions for users of our software. Using this technique, we were able to optimize what end-users identified as valuable features.  Our hypothesis testing leveraged user feedback loops from actual software usage, to continually inform future feature planning, prioritization and development activities.
pair.description = We used pair programming in our development activities, to increase collaboration and productivity.  Generally, this involved having two programmers working at a single workstation. One programmer "drove" operating the keyboard, while the other "navigated" watching, learning and making suggestions. The driver focuses on the code at hand: the syntax, semantics, and algorithm. The navigator focuses more on a higher level of abstraction: the test they are trying to get to pass, the technical task to be delivered next, and the time elapsed since all the tests were run, the time elapsed since the last repository commit, and the quality of the overall design. This practice resulted in better software design, fewer bugs, and much better spread of knowledge across a development team.
lean.description = We used Lean/Kanban method as our primary information radiator and process control mechanism.  The Kanban board served as a workflow visualization tool that enabled us to optimize the flow of our work and to communicate status, progress & concerns about the project in daily Stand ups.  This maintained high levels of verbal, direct communication and collaboration.  The Kanban board also allowed us to manage Work in Progress (WIP) which included taking on work in "small batches" that minimized any wasted time reworking large batches of work.  As such, when we had an issue (something didn't work), we became aware of it early in the process, when it could be fixed more easily.
mobile.description = We developed software that is mobile friendly through responsive web design. We did this by using Bootstrap & jQuery implementations that allow all of the content, images and structure of the site to be automatically sized and organized to effectively display on any device.
backlog.description = We used a product backlog to maintain a list of things that were envisioned for the product.  Our backlog included: features, bugs, technical work and knowledge acquisition. Through backlog grooming, we prioritized our backlog items and elaborated them with labels and short descriptions.
