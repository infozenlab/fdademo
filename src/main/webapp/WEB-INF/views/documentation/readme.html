					750 Word Brief Narrative
				</h1>
				<p>InfoZen leveraged its Agile methods and DevOps principles
					that have been honed at DHS and NASA. InfoZen's CEO assigned Jeff
					Highman as the leader/delivery manager who's accountable for the
					delivery of the solution, process, and the product within one
					week<b><sup>1</sup></b>. Jeff assembled a multidisciplinary team including a
					technical architect, front-end developer, DevOps engineer, and
					Agile coach. A lean plan was formed to align to the U.S Digital
					Services Playbook - these correlations are noted throughout this
					narrative with "Play #" citations.</p>
				<p>
					We set out to support the business hypothesis: <strong>users
						will see trends when the openFDA data is aggregated and visualized
						effectively</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>The team used personas to project users who would benefit
					from an enriched experience that would build upon openFDA<b><sup>2</sup></b>. The
					team examined the whole API to discover any limitations that could
					be overcome for system stakeholders<b><sup>3</sup></b>. We built upon the USPTO style
					guide and aligned our data visualizations accordingly<b><sup>4</sup></b>. We used a
					Kanban method, Lean UX, Continuous Integration, and DevOps
					practices<b><sup>5</sup></b>. We emulated the experience of a contract for five
					people with the requirement of shipping a production application
					deployed, tested, and documented to enable smooth handover<b><sup>6</sup></b>. Each
					team member was experienced with coding, continuous integration,
					and DevOps<b><sup>7</sup></b>. The team chose a modern, lightweight, technology stack
					based on proven open source<b><sup>8</sup></b> to enable rich functionality with deep
					security<b><sup>9</sup></b>. The application was deployed and tested on both private
					cloud (VMWare) and public cloud (AWS)<b><sup>10</sup></b>, was tested inside/out with
					automated tools/techniques,<b><sup>11</sup></b> and system performance was monitored
					in real-time<b><sup>12</sup></b>.</p>
				<p>The team used the Kanban method to track user stories,
					technical features, and documentation tasks over the lifecycle.
					They held daily stand-ups, user reviews/demos and used Lean UX
					methods that included personas, wireframes, hypothesis statement,
					and user stories to rapidly assimilate the development. The
					developers tested the API for variations of the hypothesis against
					usability criteria. The team collectively decided on application
					architecture that enabled data to be aggregated and visualized. The
					team defined continuous integration tooling and target deployment
					containers. The selected user interface included Bootstrap, D3.js,
					and JQuery. The back-end API layer was Java-based and used Spring
					MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf Template engine, and SLF4J. The
					continuous integration was based on Maven, Jenkins, JUnit, and
					Selenium. The code was tracked on version control with Git with
					libraries managed by Nexus. The target build environments were
					CentOS hosting Tomcat built with Vagrant. The developers used the
					Eclipse IDE. The team produced low-fidelity diagrams to seed
					development which began on day one. Features were developed as
					fully functional vertical slices of the application that were
					verified by the product owner. The team took an API-first approach
					that made these options addressable through a Restful-API. A
					minimum viable product was defined to include an aggregated
					visualization of drug-related data that plots the number of events
					for a given country.</p>
				<p>The functionality was tested with several layers that
					included unit testing with JUnit, UI testing with Selenium, test
					isolation with Mockito. Tests were run within the continuous
					integration pipeline with every commit of code to the Git
					repository. SonarQube was used to evaluate the code quality with
					each build. The application was deployed to end users to enable
					feedback, focus groups, and user acceptance testing. The prototype
					is cloud portable and was tested for public (AWS) and private
					(VMWare). The user interface was also tested for browser
					compatibility on major browsers.</p>
				<p>The application architecture was conceived to support the
					hypothesis that users could see trends if the data was aggregated
					and visualized. The service layer encapsulated the aggregation so
					this function could be embedded into other applications. The Spring
					framework provided a Model View Controller that allowed the
					application to be extended for advanced security, persistence, or
					caching should these needs arise. The UI Layer adopted a similar
					library to the openFDA architecture to allow these solutions to
					easily merge for a broader solution. The team extended the USPTO
					style guide, based on Bootstrap and JQuery, to provide a type-ahead
					feature so input criteria was easier for the user. In addition, 18F
					could now engage another agency by beginning with reuse.</p>
				<p>The team held a retrospective on the last day of the sprint.
					The velocity of the team was generally within the planned capacity
					and quality. The team concluded that this data set could be further
					enriched for many variations of the business hypothesis.</p>
